I am doing an internship in Data science and business analytics at The Sparks Foundation. It is really a good experience working at The Sparks Foundation. Various tasks are assigned to complete the internship.

#### TASK-1: Prediction using Supervised ML  
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. Dataset used can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data  
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?  

#### TASK -2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
