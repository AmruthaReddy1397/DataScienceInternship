I am doing an internship in Data science and business analytics at The Sparks Foundation. It is really a good experience working at The Sparks Foundation. Various tasks are assigned to complete the internship.

#### TASK-1: Prediction using Supervised ML  
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. Dataset used can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data  
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?  

#### TASK -2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

#### TASK-3: Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’  
As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

#### TASK-4: Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’   
As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?  
Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

#### TASK-5: Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’  
As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.  
Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b  

#### TASK-6: Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.  
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
